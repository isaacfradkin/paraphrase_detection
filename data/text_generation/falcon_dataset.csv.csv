I worry a lot about	I worry a lot about things like: What should I be spending my money on next? What is the best thing to buy in this particular set of circumstances (short, long, and in-between).

I worry a lot about	I worry a lot about the future, and I worry about it in a variety of ways. I think about what will happen to the world when I die, what kind of world will my children inherit, how will society change in the next 100 years, etc. And I also worry that I will be forgotten by future generations, that my legacy will not be preserved and that the human race will become extinct.
